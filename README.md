Summary
---
Currently, transit bus providers use handheld transceivers for communication which itself is inefficient. 
Commuters on the other side have no communication and knowledge on the whereabouts of buses. 
They solely rely on routines that are learned by trial and error and on responses other familiar commuters provide. 
Overall, there are no comprehensive systems that satisfy commuters' needs. Our project aims to solving this gaps. 
It automates scheduling using previous datas and allow commuters to see the wareabouts of buses.
